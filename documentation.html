                         <p>Through The Eye Magazine, users have the opportunity to read their favourite articles through layouts from eight different historical periods. The decision to represent the typographic style of different eras is intended to provide a general overview of the evolution of layout design and typographic styles over the centuries, from manuscript form to automatic reading of the future.  Each layout has been designed to capture the use of fonts, margins, spaces, colours, layout and display of new media, providing a new interpretation of the most famous historical typographic design. Explore the documentation of each style, from 1370 to 2040 and discover how the world of typography has developed over the centuries and how our way of reading and learning has changed.</p>
                         <p>One of the most important features of the magazine is the historial theming. Users can read their favourite articles through nine different visual representations, consisting of one default style, whose aim is to mimic the standardized form of a simple html file, and eight historical themes, which characterized, with their distinguishable visual elements, a specific period in time. The main goal of this feature is, in fact, to provide a general overview of the evolution of layout design and typographic styles over the centuries, from the well known form of the manuscript to newer and unexpected ways of representing a textual document in the future. Each theme has been designed to capture the use of fonts, margins, spaces, colours, layout and display of content, providing an interpretation of those styles that is documentary based. The following documentation is meant to provide the criteria that led us to this final result. Each section comes with a palette of colors and a scrollable moodboard, that is a collection of referential images used by the team to accurately reproduce and testify historical detailing. An additional section about the markup rules is also provided at the end of the page. </p>

				<h5>Typographic style</h5>
								<p>To reconstruct the 1370 typographic style, we decide to take inspiration from the design of typical medieval hand-written manuscript. Even if the normalization of a layout design become relevant with the emergence of the typesetting and print, we can recognize a design structure and some recurrent elements also in hand-written manuscript. In fact, a scribe hand, coping an entire book, composed very often beautiful designed layout. The composition of these layout was characterized by some typical elements like different types of columns, minimum 2; drawings representing the content of the page; variation in letter size for emphasise something and decorated with drawings, plants, flower in harmonic colour. </p>
								<p>Following the historical elements, the content appears in two justified columns with medium outer margins. We decide to use an old paper texture to recreate the appearance of reading a real manuscript. The predominant colour is black for the text and we decided to add other two colour, the green for the first letters of the first paragraph and red for the external links, because, as you can see in the images below, the use of different colour for some parts of the text was common. The letter spacing and the line height were minimized to express better the idea of a hand-written text. The text is justified because for the scribes was usual to draw some lines to make the text more regular.</p>
							<h5>Fonts and Typographic elements</h5>
								<p>One of the typical characteristics of manuscripts is the difficulty of the typographic typefaces, totally different from those to which we are familiar. This characteristic makes the manuscripts very often illegible by an unspecialized public. Just for this and not to lose the historical rendering, we have chosen for the content a fairly readable font that recalls the medieval style, Seagram. Instead, we decided to dedicate great attention to the capital letters, which, thanks to the MiddleAges font, imitate the illuminated initials typical of medieval manuscripts. This font in fact is particularly performing: each letter is expressed through a drawing in classic medieval style, with people portrayed in medieval clothes and grotesque and fantastic animals.</p>
								<p>Concerning the images, in the manuscripts there were many representations and drawings, very often of ecclesiastical nature, made by hand by the copyists after the writing of the text. Restoring such a format for obvious reasons is very complicated so we decided to match the colour of the images with the rest of the texture by adding a sepia filter and a large double margin to imitate the drawn frame of real manuscripts.</p>
							<h5>Cover</h5>
								<p>The cover is a representation of a typical first manuscript page. The graphic predominance of this part is evident because in addition to the old paper texture we decided to add a medieval style frame surrounding the titles of each issue. The frame presents designs that recall the ancient stories of medieval knights and ladies. The content is divided into two columns and the capital letters of each title are in the MiddleAges font to give the appearance of the hand-drawn code.</p>

                            <h5>Typographic style</h5>
								<p>To readapt the XVIth century typographic style we decided to reproduce on screen the style of a Cinquecentina. The term Cinquecentina it’s usually used to refer to the printed books of the XVIth century. Among this set of documents, a specific attention goes to those produced in Venice across the ‘500, since it’s estimated that in the city were printed half of the books circulating in Europe.</p>
								<p>So, we took as a model the layout of a Venetian Cinquecentina, but we restyled it in order to adapt it to the unpaginated medium of nowadays browsers.  The content appears on one justified column, large outer margins, and larger margins at the foot then at the head. However, in order to maintain the overflow of the text on the y-axis, typical of modern online publishing, the division between recto and verso of printed books was substituted by a one-column layout that resembles the act of reading a parchment. </p>
								<p>Besides that, the proportions among the elements of the page (e.g. margins, font-sizes) were chosen by considering the classical rules of proportions, more specifically the so-called Golden Ratio (a ratio of 1.61). In addition, our layout reuses many elements of a XVth century Incunabula, such as thick borders and drop caps. By the way, XVIth century typographic style distinguishes itself from that of the XVth by a wider use of white spaces, large paddings, letter-spacing and line-height. </p>
							<h5>Fonts and Typographic elements</h5>
								<p>Since the most common typeface in the context of historical Venetian printed books was the lettera antiqua, due to its adoption by Aldo Manuzio, we decided to choose for our layouts <i>Hultog</i>, a simple "antiqued" font based on some classic Venetian-style typefaces, both normal and coursive. For Drop Caps we chose <i>Goudy Initialen</i> that resembles engraved floral initials of the time. </p>
								<p>Since the wide use of illustration at the time, we decided to place images at the center and give them max-width, by also separating them from text by thick borders and large paddings. For the table we tried to reproduce the style of the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22Diaologo_di_M._Lodovico_Dolce,_nel_quale_si_ragiona_del_modo_di_accrescere_e_conservar_la_memoria%22._Venezia,_Giovanni_Battista_e_Melchiorre_Sessa,_1562.jpg" target="_blank">"Diaologo di M. Lodovico Dolce, nel quale si ragiona del modo di accrescere e conservar la memoria"</a> and for lists we used upper roman numbers harmonically alligned. </p>
							<h5>Cover</h5>
                <p>The cover presents a center-alignment of the text, with bibliographic information about the issue at the bottom and our Printer's mark (of course <i>The Eye</i>!) on top of this, as it was used by printers like the famous Aldo Manuzio. </p>

                             <h4 class="documentationtitle">1860</h4>
                             <p>1860 is a typographic style inspired by XIXth century newspaper and journals. The social, cultural and technological innovations of the century revolutionized printing press to the point of making journalism a market sustained by mass consumption and advertisement. With respect to the classical style of the printing press, in the second half of the XIXth century we assist to dramatical changes in the typographical choices, especially with respect to newspapers and periodicals. The sparse and harmonic disposition of types across the page, typical of the XVIth century, is substituted by a dense disposition of the text across multiple columns in the same page, with lesser line height and smaller margins. These stylistic choices were mainly due to the dramatic presence of advertisements, which occupied the majority of the pages of a journal. </p>
                <p>Thus, we tried to mimic the typography of the second half of the 1800 by opting for small paddings, diminishing the line height and the font-sizes and displaying the text homogeneously across a 3-column-layout. The choice to condense whitespaces was taken often to the detriment of readability, like in the case of words that break at each newline. To evidence some parts of the text, like headings, we use a condensed version of <i>myFHA</i>, a font family inspired by Frank H. Atkinson, an influencial typographer in the context of the Art Nouveau. For the paragraphs we chose Bodoni, a serif font which is one of the most common modern typefaces invented in the XIXth century. We made header images and tables to spread across all columns, to get an <i>in-your-face</i> look. Article images were made smaller and limited to one column to not diminish the density of the page. </p>
                <p>The cover presents our mark with a style that resembles XIXth century illustrations, and the image is placed under the title, with a large width, at the center of the cover. For the title of the issue we adopted “The Wanters”, a vintage typeface with quirky curved serif, perfectly designed for headings that give a XIXth century feel. </p>

                            <p>The twenties of the last century did not spare their roar even towards graphic design and typography. 
                            If the cinematographic, literary and musical environments were affected by great changes and innovative trends, during the roaring twenties also the representation of information was subject of in-depth reflections, revolutionary thoughts and in some cases matter of study of important design schools. 
                            In this era of great industrial expansion, of revolutionary social movements and of an artistic taste mainly influenced by art decò, graphic design also turned towards innovation, in a research – albeit divided into numerous different currents – towards the essentiality of the form and the objective truth of the written message.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Artistical and storical background: the 20s visual culture towards De Stijl, Bauhaus and Constructivism.</h5>
                            <p>Finding a starting date of this phase of great revolutions of taste is almost impossible, but certainly, among the forerunners of a new form of art in general and graphic design in particular, there cannot be not mentioned Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg. Coiners of the term "Neoplasticism", which appeared for the first time in 1917 in the starting issue of the magazine ‘De Stijl’ founded by van Doesburg, they used it to describe their new idea of art, characterized by abstraction, essentiality and geometry. Starting from the Netherlands, it was used to define the corpus of works created under their influence in the span of time between 1917 and 1931, mainly in Northern Europe. The proponents of De Stijl supported <b>pure abstraction and universality</b> through the <b>simplification of the visual compositions</b>, reduced to the essentiality of its forms and colors: <b>lines that unfold horizontally and vertically</b> building bi-dimensional spaces painted in <b>red, blue, yellow, white and black</b> with the final aim to bring the public into intimate contact with the immutable core of reality they wished to represent in its works.</p>
                            
                            <p>Strengthened by these absolute principles, Neoplasticism started to assert itself on a larger scale. In particular, in the lively historical-cultural context of the Weimar Republic, its influence found fertile ground in the encounter with a newly born artistic movement, destined to become one of the most important references for the so-called Modern Movement. With the full name of Staatliches Bauhaus, it was born from the ideas of the architect Walter Gropius and soon became a design school firstly based in Weimar, then in Dessau, Berlin until 1933, when it was closed by the Nazi censorship. Heir of the pre-war avant-gardes and the post-Industrial Revolution cultural climate, it established a <b>deep link between art and its functionality</b>, especially in the context of industry, trade and crafts. The artistic conception of the Bauhuaus extended much more globally than the neoplastic one, overflowing the boundaries of figurative art and embracing every constructive activity: from bookbinding to ceramics, from furniture to architecture, from sculpture to typography. This latter one was absolved to a new kind of art, and also, one of the most important one by extraordinary teachers of the school. Among these, Moholy-Nagy, appointed in 1923, started to consider <b>typography primarily as a communications medium</b>, concerned with the clarity of the message:  through the combination of text and photography into interrelated compositions he managed to create a new form of expression named <b>Typofoto</b>. In 1925, then, the teacher Herbert Bayer, commissioned to design a typeface for all Bauhaus communications, created an idealist typeface, coming to a <b>universal, simple geometric sans-serif font</b>. Thank to them, starting from the Dessau period, all students were then required to attend two semesters of the lettering design course, as part of a basic curriculum in the mechanics of visual education.</p>

                            <p>Great revolutions in graphic design took place throughout the twenties not only in the Western and European world, but also in the East, where they mixed with the force of very important political and social revolutions. In post-revolutionary Russia, indeed, an artistic movement born in 1915 from the genius of Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko, the Constructivism, reached in these years its peak and its ideal realization. Aimed at unhinging the visual gesture as a natural act revealing its internal mechanisms and bringing to light, the deterministic procedures that concur to "build" our way of looking at the world, it was focus on what of the sight we leave behind in the natural flow of life. Constructivists used art to access to objective truth: they rejected decorative stylization in favor of the <b>industrial assembly of materials</b>, the aestheticism of naturalistic art in favor of an art capable of reproducing a gaze based on the <b>constructive act of the individual elements of vision</b>. <b>Geometrical forms, bidimensional shapes, flat colors and diagonal bold characters</b> are characteristics typical of the constructivist movement in typography and graphic design. This abstract and austere art, intent on reflecting modern industrial society and the progress of the new urban world, suddenly became the art of the Communist Revolution. But, after having produced some of the best works of art for the soviet propaganda, it was then criticized and finally rejected by the government in the 30s, so as to state the end, in the eastern as in the western world, of a decade of freedom of expression and revolution.</p>

                            <h5>The layout</h5>
                            <p>The layout of the article is inspired by each of these historical influences, seeking to emulate that wave of novelty, revolutionary taste and desire to detach from tradition. It aims at satisfying both functionality criteria - that is, the ability to immediately convey the communicative function that is proper to it - as well as the taste of the period, creating balance between the elements of the page and realizing a composition able to amaze the reader.</p>
                            <p>A strong difference distinguishes the header from the body of the text. The first one is inspired by one of the most popular forms of communication at the time: <b>posters</b>. Large words in a black and bold font stand out, positioned diagonally on the left side of the page, representing title, subtitle and publication information in thick and uppercase characters that recall the constructivist propaganda. They cover the 60% of the total page and are counterclockwisly inclined of 7 degrees, in contrast with the background image. This latter one is a vector image  inspired by one of the most famous symbols of the Bauhuaus school. The cover picture, if present, is not detached from the text, but rather integrates it and amplifies its informative scope, as happened in the covers of newspapers such as "bauhuaus" and books such as "Es kommt der neue Fotograf" by Werner Graff (Berlin, 1929). The whole cover has then a solid and thick upper and lower border (10 px black), which recalls one of the most common features of the time.</p>
                            <p>The layout of the body is primarily inspired by the <b>“bauhuas” newspapers</b>, which first came out in 1926 with a clean, simple and minimalist graphics of great impact. It is drawn up following the principles of <b>asymmetry and balance between full and empty elements within the page</b>. As example, the main text occupies only 70% of the page, positioning itself on the right thanks to a large margin-left (margin-left: 30%), giving us the possibility to give breath to the whole page and at the same time to highlight all the additional elements which are instead positioned on the left side. Titles and subtitles, enlarged with respect to the text and with a very thick upper red border, are used to visually recreate the idea of <b>breaking down the text into blocks</b> and to functionally represent at a first glance the semantic subdivision of the article itself into chapters and paragraphs. Finally, <b>black and white images</b> are separated from the text, on the left of the page, to complete the same information function with another medium.</p>
                            <p>The information contained in the page footer is structured as squared blocks, with fonts of a smaller size than the main body and equipped with different <b>borders</b>, from the thinnest to the thickest, recalling one of the innovations brought to the graphic design of the time by the Bauhaus newspaper and, even earlier, from von Doesburg's periodical.</p>

                            <h5>The cover and the disclaimer</h5>
                            <p>The cover is inspired by one of the most famous books from the Bauhuas library: the <b>5th Bauhausbucker</b> which, edited by Piet Mondrian, represents a point of contact between the Bauhuas and De Stijl and also takes the form of a long theoretical dissertation on graphic design.</p>
                            <p>Despite its simplicity, this issue demonstrates an impressive series of innovative choices in the graphic field. The colors used belong to a very limited palette but are capable of declaring a bold stylistic choice that stands out from all the rest. The background is thus created with the same ones, by combining a <b>linear gradient</b>  for the contrast between black and white and a vector image for the red triangle on the right bottom of the page. The characters on the cover are not limited to their usual information function but are used by themselves as decorative elements, characterized by an original font and the <b>asymmetries of the single letters</b>. The titles of the articles, that are not present in the Bauhuasbucker cover, are in our design smaller and more homogeneous, both with each other and with the rest of the information on the page, as is typical of many minimalist Bauhaus posters.</p> 
                            <p>The disclaimer, on the other hand, takes the form of an imaginary back cover of this same book, whose realization left more space for imagination. The composition, the background images and the background itself follow those of the cover, but rotated 90 degrees as if the book had been ideally flipped on.</p>

                            <h5>The colors</h5>
                            <p>The use of colors follows the <b>Bauhaus and Neoplasticism palette</b>, favoring <b>primary colors</b> with the addition of <b>white</b> as a union of all colors and <b>black</b> as the absence of any color.</p>
                            <p>The study of color was already very important in Neoplasticism - just think of the primary triad of <b>Mondrian's paintings</b> - but during the Bauhuas it became a real philosophy. In particular, the arrival at the school in 1919 of <b>Johannes Itten</b> gave way to a branch of studies on the harmony of colors destined to influence the world of graphics  still today. By analyzing the color circle through geometric figures, Itten claims to be able to find the most harmonious color combinations existing in reality. Red, blue and yellow is the first and most powerful of these “essential chromatic contrasts”, capable of perfectly balancing the relationship between light and dark, the brilliance and saturation of colors. However, the correlation between shapes and colors is not new in the Bauhaus: in 1923 <b>Kandinksij</b> conducted a very famous questionnaire in which he asks his students to associate the three primary colors with the three basic shapes (square, circle and triangle). Despite the disparate answers, the painter manages to conclude that the square is inherently red, the triangle yellow and the circle blue. Surprisingly, recent psychology studies also confirm this hypothesis.</p>

                            <h5>The tipography</h5>
                            <p>In <b>Bayer's design</b>, not only were serifs unnecessary, but there was no need for upper and lower case letters for each letter, favoring the maximum simplification of the composition. Attempts to emulate the universal typeface have been made throughout the history of the Bauhuas and beyond, such as the <b>Joseph Albers</b> modular font system based on 10 basic shapes derived from a circle and a square and <b>Ed Benguiat and Victor Caruso</b>'s newer ITC Bauhuas typeface , clearly inspired by those ideas of the teachers.</p>
                            <p>The main typographic innovations of the Bauhuas can be recognized in <b>the elimination of capital letters</b> and the replacement of the archaic Gothic alphabet used in German with <b>a modern and cosmopolitan font</b>, built to represent the essence of the message written with <b>the fewest possible lines</b>.</p>
                            <p>We therefore used a sans serif font able to get as close as possible to that of Bahuerian ideation, finding the perfect example in the Google Font <b>"Comfortaa"</b> font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?query= comfo & sidebar.open = true & selection.family = Comfortaa: wght @ 300), used for the body transformed in <b>lowercase</b>. A different choice involved the head of the articles and some writings on the cover, which were instead drawn up using the font <b>"Strasua"</b>, a capital sans-serif able to evoke that drive towards the future and the bold font of constructivist typography.</p>

                            <h5>The tables</h5>
                            <p>The tables present in some of the gathered articles have been styled so as to emulate the famous beautiful <b>Mondrian paintings</b>. This was possible through the use of thick borders and the use of pseudo-selectors to paint each cell in different colors among blue, yellow, white and very light grey. </p>

                            <h5>80s Magazines</h5>
 
<p>The Eighties were such a tubular time in popular culture that it can be challenging to find authentic graphic design from that decade. Most of the material that is on the Internet is actually current and was only inspired by the ’80s. It can be very easy to stumble into some unoriginal information, created after the retro trend hit the twenty-tens. In order to avoid that, we decided to focus on scans of authentic magazines issues, published between 1980 and 1989. In particular, the historical theming is based on journals made for and sold to teenagers, which mainly focused on music, fashion, celebrities and television. Most of our inspirations come from a selected group of bold, cheap, and teen-centric magazines that use a very specific graphic style, which has nothing to do with other graphic design styles that are usually referenced when one talks about the 80s. For example, in these magazines there’s no sign of Neon Noir, Tropical, ’80s Cute, Fantasy or Digital inspired graphics. These huge trends never have a huge space on teen magazines, for they have been more influenced by Memphis-Milano Style and ’80s Deco.</p>
<p>The referenced magazines are: Smash Hits, Teen Beat, Tiger Beat, No.1 Magazine, Bop, Teen Talk, Teen Magazine, Look In.</p>
 
<p>Scans of these magazines were used as documentary material when creating the historical theme and they can be found in the moodboard at the end of this section. In particular, the final layout of the issue is intended to reproduce the original position and column division of textual and non-textual elements found in the images. When this was not possible, i.e. in the case of tables, we came up with a design that could fit the general trends of the historical period. Cover and disclaimer are intended as the actual front cover and back cover of a physical magazine. This is why they both have a barcode in the bottom part. However, for the disclaimer, it was not possible to find a back cover that did not feature some kind of photographic advertisement. It holds true what was said for the design of tables.</p>
 
 
<h5>Typography</h5>
 
<p>When talking about the graphic design trend of those years, it stands out that most of the fonts used were custom made. In many cases they take on a form of illustration rather than design/layout and it is clear that there was a lot of detail and storytelling happening in the lettering. The development of music, gaming and technology certainly contributed to the evolution of typography in this period. The emergence of digital typography in the 1980s prompted development of fonts for computer screens and laser printing. Another clear trend is that most of the fonts used seem to be very traditional and serif. This happened because early digital fonts were digitizations of traditional analog designs. For this reason, we decided to use very commonly used serif fonts for the body of the article, which had a non-serious twist in their rendition. In other elements, we applied playful fonts that used to mimic teenagers' handwriting style, as if the magazines were already annotated by the owners. ITC Garamond is the perfect example. It was the font chosen by Apple Computer in the 80s and it clearly reflects the idea of the Macintosh being a serious corporate workstation, but also being user friendly at the same time.</p>
 
<p>The same principle can be applied in the fonts used for the cover. They are a mixed selection of classical and non-classical typography styles. On the same page we can see two completely different fonts: Bodoni FLF Roman and ComicNeue, which have been historically used in opposite publications: Bodoni, the serif typefaces first designed by Giambattista Bodoni in the late eighteenth century, is related to more serious publication and has become the recognizable mark of editions such as the ones published by Franco Maria Ricci. On the other side, ComicNeue, as the name suggests, is the typeface that characterized balloon text in the comic book series of the 80s. However, more serif and classical fonts can be seen used in an unusual way.</p>
 
<p>An example of this behavior can be seen in the stripes at the top and bottom of the cover page. For these elements we decided to mimic an atypical use of Bodoni, which can be seen in the famous cover of Franco Battiato’s Patriots record, designed by Francesco Messina. It represents the perfect example of the playful use of fonts in the Eighties: big weighted and classical styled characters, separated by recurring dots and irregular shapes, with long letter spacing.</p>
 
<p>The elements described before can be found in almost every reference analyzed. When it comes to magazines, you can almost always see how first-letters are in a different font from the one of the paragraphs and in a bigger size. Most of the time they are red in color, creating a contrast with the black of the text unit. Titles, inside and outside the article, are decorated with a huge colored bottom border or with two big dots, before and after an important word or the name of a person. Letter spacing is hugely used, such as in the references, as long as where it was possible against responsiveness limits and screen restrictions. The use of multiple fonts is a trademark of those years’ publications. For this reason, it can happen to have more than five or six typefaces inside an article. Line height is bigger in blockquote elements or in other external sections, and it is used to give more credit to such information, allowing them to stand out from the columned text.</p>
 
 
 
<h5>Colors & Images</h5>
 
<p>The economic upturn of the 80s brought bold colors, and black and white. Graffiti and artists like Keith Haring, captured the vibes of the time in red, blue, green and yellow. At the same time, colors such as dusty rose (mauve), became popular for interior design. The colors are slightly faded and don't really pop like they once did or like they will do in the 90s. The ’80s saw a surge in ultra-luxe colors that reflected the affluence of the time and that we decided to not feature in our style in order to respect the historical credibility of the theming. In fact, colors listed in the palette below were picked directly from the referential images.  Pastels had a huge moment in those years with shows like Miami Vice and the turquoise, peach and mauve of the Southwestern interior design movement. We also decided to use a beige color for the main background. This was done in the attempt of reproducing the color of the paper of vintage magazines and, also, to allow the overlapping of multiple layers of background patterns. Colors are solid and gradients are not used.</p>
 
 
<p>With regards to images, they have all been passed under some filter effects, in order to reproduce an overly saturated retro aesthetic, also adding a touch of contrast and a reddish-brown undertone. In addition to that, images come with three different decoration styles and as many effects for figures’ captions. All three have in common an abundant border size, the use of shadows, dotted lines and other decorations. Their dimension is limited to the dimension of columns inside the article.</p>
 
 
 
<h5>Memphis Style</h5>
 
<p>In 1981, Italian designer Ettore Sottsass founded a group of artists and designers called Memphis. Bob Dylan’s song 'Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again' was playing on repeat during the group’s first meeting, which led to the group being named 'Memphis'. The Memphis Group went on to create furniture, fabrics, patterns, ceramics and other products in a distinctly Postmodern style that blended stylistic traits of 1950s kitsch, Art Deco, and Pop Art. The designs created by the Memphis Group were groundbreaking. They marked a complete separation from the dark, overly tasteful and serious design styles of the 1970s. Memphis’s fresh approach to design, which was characterized by creativity and humor, came to be a lasting stylistic hallmark of the 1980s. This style is known for its use of bright, primary and pastel colors, geometric shapes, and bold, repetitive patterns. It makes a large use of triangles, zigzag lines and creative irregular shapes, usually colorful stars and animalier prints. It can be found in detailed form in the background of the cover and it is also used for decorating images and article’s borders. Use of Memphis elements is also documented in the moodboard of scans provided below.</p>

                            <h4 class="documentationtitle">2000</h4>
                            <p>IIt won’t be excessive to consider the 2000s as the beginning of a new era for human history as well as for graphic design. In this period indeed some of the main changements destined to influence our life still nowadays were starting to happen, modifying forever, in the graphic field, the way we look at magazines.</p>

                            <h5>New millennium art</h5>
                            <p>Between the end of the 90s and the beginning of the new millennium, in a period of economic rebound and farness of the political world, the 2000s seemed the natural, indolent continuation of the previous decade.However, just at that time, some of the most important macro phenomena in contemporary history were happening, initiating a process of transformation of our lives and mentality that is still ongoing today. In particular, the 2000s were the scenario in which <b>globalization</b> took place, the beginning of <b>social movements</b> such as anti-racism and feminism, and, perhaps even more revolutionary than the first ones, the <b>advent of digital and web 2.0</b> investing art as well as our daily life.</p>
                            <p>The art of the new millennium was in fact characterized by its global breadth and by its definitive multicentricity. New and prosperous art forms born in South America, China, India and Africa. Furthermore, in the 2000s, a new female figure came out. Elegant, confident, with a working career as well as taste in everyday life choices: the new millennium marks a change in the female role, definitively transforming the twentieth-century house into a modern working woman. It was not just a new social role, but also a new type of audience targeting new types of products and publications. Finally, in the 2000s, art institutions entered the digital age, exploiting the possibilities of visualization and communication that had just been exploited before.</p>
                            <p>These characteristics of the art world are influential events in secondary art, such as graphic design. First, in the field of magazines, for example, we have witnessed the <b>boom of magazines aimed at a female audience</b>, such as Elle, Cosmopolitan and, above all, <b>Vogue</b>. They are no more simple tabloids, but magazines dedicated to a new prototype of a strong career woman, a sort of counterpoint to the newspapers that until then had been typically male. The need to dialogue with this type of public brings to magazines the search for a new form of elegance and charm, combining them with the desire to speak seriously about the problems of modern women and gilrs. These were the main source of inspiration for the realization of the historical style of the 2000s. Furthermore, since the 1990s, <b>digital design technology</b> has evolved and become more accessible, which means that the days of creating layouts by hand were rapidly disappearing. As a result, the layouts have taken on a more polished and clean look. In the mid and later part of the decade, minimalism became the order of the day, which felt completely refreshing after the 80s and 90s’ grunge.</p>

                            <h5>The layout</h5>
                            <p>Despite the predominant tendency to turn to digital and to integrate elements of digital in the graphics of the time, articles in the 2000s magazines were still read in analogic format. The layout of the article is therefore affected by the <b>printing porcess</b>: the articles were printed in <b>two or three columns</b>, in a design that facilitated reading on paper but complicates it in digital format. For this reason, we decided to minimize the number of columns while still maintaining one of the most typical characteristics of the layout of time (column-count: 2) and instead merging all the text on a single column for small devices, where column reading could have become very uncomfortable. The <b>margins</b> of the whole body are extremely small (margin: 3rem), recalling the period will to fill the whole page.</p>
                            <p>The head of the article is divided between the space dedicated to the title and that, when present (but almost always in an era that is starting to get used to multimedia), to the cover image. <b>Title and subtitle were often complementary</b> to each other, united in a game of typographic and color references. The title is usually very large in size, but printed only in lowercase, in an almost playful sans-serif font. Typically some <b>words in the title</b> of the article, those that most emphasize the content, are printed in another font and color, so as to immediately stand out from a visual point of view. They have been highlighted here thanks to the insertion of a span with id title_word, in a different font in italics and in red. The subtitle has the same font as the title, but, in addition to being smaller, it also renounces the homogenization of the lowercase. The <b>images are</b> large, intrusive, important, and often placed under the right corner of the page, here realized through a coverpic reduced to 70% and equipped with float: right; margin-top: -7%; margin-right: -7%. It is an era in which color images are now the norm, and which is also beginning to deal with multimedia: the <b>simultaneous presence of text and image is now a must</b>, enriched and enhanced in the most modern magazines. Images are in fact well enhanced even throughout the body of text: large, in the middle of the text, with a <b>caption in slight relief with white writing on a red background</b>, as it was at the time. An important element of style is the <b>first letter of each article</b>: large, lowercase and colored: in some magazines it could even occupy a quarter or a third of the page.</p>

                            <h5>The cover and the disclaimer</h5>
                            <p>Through the cover and the disclaimer of each article we tried to realize the <b>idea of a glossy magazine from the 2000s</b>. The cover is typical of those years: large title of the newspaper in an elegant and clean sans-serif font, title of the articles in white and clearly visible on the cover of the newspaper itself, all against the background of what in 99% of cases was a beautiful, charming and fashionable woman. It is the cover of a periodical: a weekly or monthly, which bears the publication date at the top right as well as the bar code that denounces its nature as a consumer product. It is not made to last, but to amaze and attract readers.</p>
                            <p>The disclaimer is the typical back cover of these glossy magazines: often entirely dedicated to advertising some women's clothing or perfumery product. Here I wanted to represent the typical advertising of the time: in black and white, with the logo written in red on the whole page, basic, almost minimal, with models far from the traditional canons of beauty.</p>

                            <h5>The colors</h5>
                            <p>Every decade, design trends shift away from trends of the previous decade and build on nostalgia for earlier times. The natural wood tones in 90s decór rejected the excess of the 1980s, which had said no to the earthy 70s. When the 2000s arrived, the <b>revival of 80s glam</b> returned in a creative way that fit with the changing times. This is particular evident in the cover and in the advertisement of the time: full of shining colors and different fonts.</p>
                            <p>The color palette is instead quite limited as regards the article itself: minimalist in the writing to entrust the full range of color to the images. <b>The palette is limited but nevertheless dedicated to a strong stylistic contrast</b> with great evocative power. It is a technique that, starting from the 1950s, has had great success in printing and graphics in the last century: that of inserting a very <b>strong contrast between a single color and black and white</b>: that is when a color stands out within a composition made of gray tones. In this case we undoubtedly chose a very canonical shade of <b>red</b>: the color of Vogue, of the Coca-Cola, and the color of modernity.</p>

                            <h5>The typography</h5>
                            <p>Games with fonts were typical of the period: mixed, confused, even within the same sentence.</p>
                            <p>Here three: for the title, for the publication info and for the body of the text. <b>Questrial Regular</b> by Google Font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Questrial#standard-styles) for the main title and for the subtitle: a sans-serif, lightweight font usually used for titles. <b>Cambo Regular</b> 400 from Google Font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cambo#standard-styles) for additional information and words in the title, for the h2 of References and so on. <b>Source Serif Pro</b> by Google Font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro) for the body text.</p>

                                   <h5>The Future of design</h5>
				   <p>Starting from the end of the 2010s we have seen a change in design directions, especially because journals and magazines have moved partially, or in same cases completely, from print to digital. Graphic design is on a collision course with experience design. Print is definitely taking a different and more risky road and web design has never been more important. Printed magazines have been adopting sharp graphic and pagination choices, trying to compete with the complexity of online presentation of written and multimedia material. This situation created a huge range of very new and very exciting projects, freeing written magazines from the chains of the homogeneous and straight designs of the 90s and 2000s, which aimed to differentiate themselves from the newborn culture of the Internet and its blogs, by using a more distinct and authoritative way of displaying content. For these reasons we decided to use as references for our historical theme both printed and web resources that are challenging the idea of traditional textual representation by rethinking the objects with the respect of the users. </p>

				  <p>In order to reach our purposes, we followed some of the principles illustrated by AIGA, one of the most important associations for design professionals. In particular we focused on <i>AIGA Designer 2025 guidelines</i>, a research project that examines seven trends shaping the context for the practice of design. The section called <i>Trend 3: Bridging Digital and Physical Experiences</i> was the theoretical starting point from which we based our design choices.</p>

				<h5>Flat design VS. Skeuomorphic</h5>
				<p>New design choices for the future start from the assumption that people are being bombarded by images and information all the time. If we want our message to be heard loud and clear, we need to take the minimalist design approach. Instead of overwhelming audiences with complex text and lots of visuals, a designer needs to present them something simple and clean that one can quickly process. One big advantage of <i>minimalism</i> in digital design is faster loading times and easier viewing on mobile devices. This is especially true if one wants to include younger audiences in its target. In particular, it has been proven that a new trend is bringing new life to design and communication. This trend is called <i>millennial minimalism</i>.</p>
 				<p>Millennial minimalism speaks directly to consumers without shouting for attention and priorities messages over structural complexity. In particular, it mixes flat design with a muted palette of colors and giant font sizes. But the new <i>flat design</i> is something completely different from when it started populating the web, in the early 2010s. It was originally marked by a complete lack of design elements such as shadows, gradients, or realistic elements with texture, starting as an alternative to skeuomorphic style, which can be defined as the design concept of making items represented resemble their real-world counterparts. Many of those design elements are now back, but have been reinterpreted under the overall idea of creating something that is <i>pleasant to watch</i>, without being visually agressing.</p>
 				<p>Future designs, especially for younger users, need to be relaxing corners for web exploration, made of <i>reassuring graphics</i>, flat illustrations, white big types and transitions effects that must always convey a <i>feeling of calmness</i>. For these reasons, text is arranged in a singular central column, that allows to create a focusing effect in reading processes, especially when it is interrupted by images or quotes, which take up a large part of the screen/page width. Also, as in most of the referenced material, title information and a main image are clearly separated from the body of the article, creating an introductory square full of information. Colors also allow a visual and meaningful separation between the article and its corollary elements. Another element that is used to break the continuous flow of the main text is represented by thin black lines, which are used to express separation of specific sections, the starting point of a table or footer information, which are, in a way, generally more structured and classical mimic.</p>

		            <h5>Gradients</h5>
			    <p>The gradient trend is an extremely versatile one and it's been used in different ways during the last fifty years. They can be bold or subtle, the focal point of a design or a background element. And because they mix and blend different shades of color, gradients can create new color combinations that feel different and modern, lending a completely unique feel to designs. When using flat and geometric graphics, gradients allow one to  add movement and deepness to the static design. Starting from 2018 gradients have seen a resurrection fame, probably driven by nostalgia, and brands have started to change and adapt their logos to this trend. We decided to incorporate a combination of soft colors for a subtle background, which also transitions and move, creating a calm wave effect. What’s trendy right now, as we have seen in the case of the most recent iPhoneX commercials, is the use of non-uniform blends which use gradient meshes or other techniques. For this reason, we decided to blend and non regularly align our gradients, which can be seen both in a continuous form (for screen visualization) and in a static radial-ramp form (for cover/print visualization) in cold tones for the back and warm tones for the front. Gradients fulfills the double function of deeping the space of interaction and creating movement. Also, in the historical theming, they are used to convey a uniformed motif, that can be used in many and repeated elements to express cohesiveness in design choices. For example, a gradient is used also for the reading progress bar, which is a recalling and fundamental element of the web page, functioning as a reminder of the dynamic nature of web page reading, also in the context of a black and white pagination.</p>

		          <h5>Typography</h5>
			  <p>Following the report proposed by Monotype about the state of art of type design and their predictions, we decided to follow what they consider to be the most influential and successful trends for the next future.</p> 
			  <p>The first prediction concerns the use of types in multi-platform systems and responsive environments, where we can clearly see a <i>rise of variable fonts</i>, which is going to increase dramatically in the next decade. Another trend seems to concern the <i>geometric sans serif</i>, which isn't going anywhere soon and has become a kind of identity for the digital world, tech companies, startups and such. In fact, companies are using the same style of typeface, in order to immediately link themselves with this world of innovations. For example, in recent years we have seen how most brands, both in fashion or in the editorial world, have abandoned the idea of a logo that uses custom typefaces, preferring a more neutral and minimal use of geometric and regular lettering, which deliver a clear and consistent brand personality over multiple touchpoints. For these reasons, we chose simple yet remarkably fresh fonts, such as the Eksell Display, a unique typeface from 1962, designed by the legendary swedish designer <i>Olle Eksell</i>, and rediscovered in recent years for its geometric sharp edges and yet traditional based shapes.</p>
			  <p>Another relevant trend of recent years regards headlines positioning, which are being  moved to the borders and rotated in 90 degrees, thereby naturally giving way to the main or central text. This is also true for blockquotes, which need to occupy as much space as possible. This mix of horizontal and vertical texts has emerged as a stylistic approach to breaking up blocks of text. The trend creates white space and elicits a wow effect by abandoning the age-old horizontal alignment.  Incredibly, the wow effect created by the rotation of the letters or of entire lines drives the reader to these unusual points of interest and slows down the reading speed, allowing a deeper concentration on usually ignored parts of text. The results indicate that reading vertically presented text from a display device may be nearly as eﬃcient as reading normal horizontal text. Therefore, the fact that text is normally vertically arranged in small-screen devices is not a usability problem.<p>

                             <h4 class="documentationtitle">2040</h4>
				  <h5>Typographic style</h5>
                            		<p>Very often, when we imagine the future of typography, the predominant aspect is a sensationally technological vision, with 3D images, visual effects and graphics. In this context, precisely because this image is very popular and risks being obvious, we asked ourselves: what will the future look like?  
				   	 What will be the ideals that will inspire us? And how will these ideals be expressed? In the typographic style of age 2040, we tried to summarize our idea: we imagine that in the future anything, and first of all technology, will be a transfer for an important message: a sustainable way of living. 
				   	 And we also imagine that magazines and articles will have to be much more accessible than now, allowing the use of content in different ways.</p>
				  	<p>First of all, we opted for a palette that recalls the canons of dark mode. Dark mode is a set of rules with the purpose of reduce the luminance emitted by device screens, while still meeting minimum colour contrast ratios. They help improve visual ergonomics by reducing eye strain, adjusting brightness to current lighting conditions, and facilitating screen use in dark environments.</p>
				 	 <p>Material Design dark themes are defined by the following properties:</p>
				  		<ul>
							<li>•	Contrast: Dark surfaces and 100% white body text have a contrast level of at least 15.8:1 </li>
							<li>•	Depth: At higher levels of elevation, components express depth by displaying lighter surface colours</li>
							<li>•	Desaturation: Primary colours are desaturated so they pass the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines’ (WCAG) AA standard of at least 4.5:1 (when used with body text) at all elevation levels</li>
							<li>•	Limited colour: Large surfaces use a dark surface colour, with limited colour accents (light, desaturated and bright, saturated colours)</li>
				  		</ul>
				  	<p>The whole style palette of this layout follows the principles of dark mode based on shades of dark green without using pure white and pure black which make reading more complicated. We decided to use this design because we think that, in the future more than now, our eyes and our sight will be over-stressed and dark mode can relieve the fatigue in reading. 
					  Specifically, we have chosen to use the principles of dark mode applied to dark green tones for the background and a light ivory-like colour for the text because these colours recall the themes of environmental sustainability and ecology.</p>
				  	<p>The second innovative element of this layout is the possibility to choose whether to read or listen to the selected article. This option may either reach out to the needs of people with disabilities but may allow the user to access the article in a different way. Already now podcasts and audiobooks have become very popular and we think that in the future these tools will be required on any kind of platform. 
					  We have included the reader with the help of an external library that automatically reads the content of the article. </p>
				  	<p>The reading is done by an automatic reader but can be implemented in the future. We took our inspiration from some already existing online magazines give the possibility to listen to the article read directly by the author. </p>
				  <h5>Fonts and Typographic elements</h5>
				  <p>Following the forecasts already mentioned in the paragraph dedicated to the layout typography of 2025, also for the style of 2040 we preferring a more neutral and minimal use of geometric and regular lettering and spacing. For the content we opted for a regular font, Optima Nova LT Pro, a sans serif font which, with its full but regular shapes, is also suitable for reading in dark mode. </p>
				  <p>For the titles and also for the cover we opted for a font already in use since 2017 but recently restyled, Morion. The font has different versions and for this typographic style we used Morion Regular and Morion Bold.
					As we can read from the official website, Morion is a balancing act between text and display type. Morion is capable to be used as running text at small sizes yet is equally as strong in large scale display settings. The final release is accompanied by a carefully designed and edited specimen which comes in the form of a 110-page paperback that challenges the reader with an unconventional form of content. </p>
				  <p>Already present in the 2025 design, we kept the first letter of the first paragraph larger than the rest of the text as constant and used the font 'Susanna' only for this feature. 
					The content is displayed in the centre of the page, with large margins on desktop mode, which is then reduced to smartphone mode to ensure optimum readability at all times.</p>
				  <p>Following the latest trends in many typographical layouts, blockquotes occupy as much space as possible and have a much larger font than the rest of the text. They are also isolated with a different background.
					The images, to follow the style of dark mode, have a filter that limits their brightness, so even in the case of bright colours and a higher brightness of the screen do not annoy the view. Also, to give more interactivity to the whole layout, when the mouse scrolls over them they present a small animation that enlarges and decreases them depending on the scrolling. 
					  At the end of each article we have chosen to place a footer image with a slogan that recalls sustainability and care for an environmentally friendly lifestyle. The aim is to reinforce the concept that technology can be the vehicle through which crucial messages for our future are conveyed.</p>
				  <h5>Usability</h5>
				  <p>The 2040 design is designed to meet the user's needs. The dark mode, as mentioned above, is aimed at not further stressing the eyesight, already overloaded by the frequent use of different devices. Moreover, the possibility of listening to the article can satisfy different needs of the user. First, the user can listen to the article while conducting other operations, as is already the case with audio books at present. 
					  Secondly, it can be a useful feature for users with disabilities: by offering this function by default for this mode, the site can facilitate the interaction of users with different abilities or visual difficulties. Finally, the user can listen and read the article quickly, focusing only on the images or more specific content of the topic (e.g. tables or graphs). 
					The player located on the right side of the page is fixed and then scrolls along with the article, so that the user can stop and restart reading at any time he or she wishes.</p>
				  <h5>Cover</h5>
				  <p>For the 2040 style cover we decided to focus on the main information: the title of the article. This choice was made in order to immediately capture the user's attention, already strongly stimulated by numerous inputs. 
					Also the cover respects the article palette and the font used is Morion Bold, the same used for the titles within the articles. Each title is enclosed within a coloured band of the dark mode palette defined by the style in descending order, from the darkest to the lightest. The background is re-proposed with naturalistic elements to recall the theme of sustainability.</p>

                            <p>In order to apply all our typographic choices and to provide additional information about the content we decided to enrich our articles with particular markup elements that we defined. More specifically we can divide this additional elements in two types: <b>structural elements</b> and <b>semantic elements</b>. Structural markup allow us to divide the page in units characterised by spefic design features, while semantic markup allow us to highlight and extract information about the content and the context of each article.</p>
                            <p>With respecto to structural elements, we designed our page following a tree-structure: we have a root node specified by the id <b>ArticleBody</b> that has 3 main children departing from it, <b>CoverWrapper</b>, <b>ContentWrapper</b> and <b>FootWrapper</b>. Moreover, to add peculiar characteristics for the header of the articles in each style, we decided to divide the content of the first child in three <i>div</i>s, whose classes are <b>coverpic</b>, <b>title</b> and <b>coverinfo</b>.</p>
                            <p>Regarding semantic elements, they might be grouped into <b>meta elements</b>, <b>block elements</b> and <b>inline elements</b>. Meta elements are <b>metadata</b> contained in the &lt;head&gt; of each article, such as title, author, publication date, publisher, identifier, format, type and keywords, specified in the <b>Dublin Core</b> vocabulary. Block elements are the HTML elements <b>&lt;section&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;h2&gt;</b>, that we used to markup specific semantic units of a long read, such as titles, subtitles, sections, byline and publication notes. Inline elements, instead, are used to markup atomic pieces of information in the discourse of the text, such as <b>named entities</b>, which we marked-up with classes such as person, place, event, concept and entity, <b>references</b>, <b>asides</b> and <b>footnotes</b>.</p>
                            <p>Finally we decided to store metadata about each issue in the &lt;head&gt; of their respective html page.</p>
